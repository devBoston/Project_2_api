## Ruby on Rails API

This is the back end to my full-stack project.

## Resources
Ruby on Rails HTML 

## Planning
I started this project by drafting user stories and wireframes, along with an ERD. The next step was to scaffold the resource and test that all the actions were working with curl scripts. Once the end points were connected, I was able to deploy my server and started to work on the front end. 

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to add a many-to-many relationship in the resources to make my project a little more complex.
